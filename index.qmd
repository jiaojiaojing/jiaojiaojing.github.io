## Welcome
My lab applies quantitative approaches—including **Mathematical modeling**, **Statistical analysis**, **Artificial intelligence**, and **Machine learning** — to investigate species interactions across space and time.

**Current research focuses on:**
- Exploring non‑linear dynamics in coinfection;
- Studying vector‑borne infectious diseases in the context of seasonal migration;
- Modeling seasonal growth of vectors;
- Understanding nationwide disease‑control strategies under social and psychological influences.
