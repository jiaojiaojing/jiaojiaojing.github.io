## Welcome

My lab applies **quantitative approaches**—including **mathematical modeling**, **statistical analysis**, **artificial intelligence**, and **machine learning**—to investigate species interactions across space and time.

**Current research focuses on:**
- Exploring non-linear dynamics in coinfection;
- Studying vector-borne infectious diseases in the context of seasonal migration;
- Modeling seasonal growth of vectors;
- Understanding nationwide disease-control strategies under social and psychological influences.
