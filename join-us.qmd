## Join Our Lab

We are always excited to connect with passionate and curious students and researchers interested in our work at the intersection of ecology, epidemiology, and quantitative methods.

While we do not have any funded openings at this time, we believe the best collaborations start with a conversation. We welcome inquiries from prospective undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers who find our work inspiring.

If you are interested in potential future opportunities, please feel free to reach out to Dr. Jiao at [jing.jiao@tcu.edu](mailto:jing.jiao@tcu.edu). In your email, please include:
- Your CV or resume
- A brief description of your research interests and how they align with our lab
