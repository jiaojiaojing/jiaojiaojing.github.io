I focus on clear goals, brief in-class problem solving, and transparent criteria. In first-year General Biology, students work with **real datasets** in short, guided exercises (with or without simple R code).

**Courses**
- General Biology (first-year)
- Biostatistics (graduate)
- Evolution, Disease, & Medicine

**Materials**
- Syllabus (sample) — add link  
- Short data module (R + CSV) — add link
