## Our Research Focus

My lab applies **quantitative tools** to understand species interactions and disease spread across space and time.

We are particularly interested in how theoretical modeling and data-driven analyses can be integrated to reveal mechanisms underlying biodiversity, disease dynamics, and global change.

## Research Themes

1. **Theoretical Modeling of Biotic & Abiotic Mechanisms**  
   We develop ecological and epidemiological theory to explain how **biotic** (e.g., species traits, interactions) and **abiotic** (e.g., climate, disturbance) factors shape patterns observed in the field and laboratory.

2. **Statistical Analysis of Mixed Mechanisms**  
   We build **statistical models** to dissect the complex interplay of multiple mechanisms within empirical datasets.

3. **Theoryâ€“Data Integration**  
   We combine theoretical insights and statistical inference to strengthen our understanding of ecological and epidemiological systems.

4. **Advanced Tools for Big Data**  
   We explore machine learning and **AI-based tools** for analyzing large-scale ecological and health data.
