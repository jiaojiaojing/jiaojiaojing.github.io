We use a variety of computational tools to support ecological modeling, statistical analysis, and data visualization:

- 🧮 **R language** – statistics, modeling, visualization
- 📐 **Maple** – symbolic computation, theoretical modeling
- 🧠 **MATLAB** – numerical simulations and custom models
- 🐍 **Python** – data science, modeling, machine learning

We are actively exploring **AI tools** for large-scale ecological and health data applications — more details coming soon.
