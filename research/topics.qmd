## Major Topics We Explore

- **Coinfection and Environmental Change**  
  Investigating how coinfection combined with environmental variation jointly influence multiple pathogens/ or parasites interactions.

*R permutation test to detect non-linearity of coinfection with refinement of bin width and dataset grouping positions. The visualization shows local expansion around promising bins where point fill represents exact p-values and point size indicates total n per bin.*

- **Species Invasions and Biodiversity**  
  Understanding how invasive species alter community structure, competition, and disease dynamics.

- **Disease Ecology and Public Health**  
  Modeling hostâ€“pathogen systems and assessing risk factors for disease emergence and spread.
