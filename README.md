# Jing Jiao Personal Site (Quarto)

A clean, lab-style website similar in structure to many R Markdown/Quarto academic sites. Push to a public repo named **jiaojiaojing.github.io** to publish via GitHub Pages.

## Quick start
1. Create public repo `jiaojiaojing.github.io`.
2. Copy these files into the repo and push to `main`.
3. In repo: Settings → Pages → Source = GitHub Actions.
4. Edit `index.qmd`, `projects.qmd`, and add links to CV/Scholar.

**Safety:** Project pages show **teasers** only. Release full code/data after acceptance.
